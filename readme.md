# FFXIV TexTools

TexTools is a FFXIV Modding Framework for both mod creation and use/installation. 

It was originally created by Liinko in 2016, but has since been greatly updated and extended by the TexTools Github Group.


You can download TexTool Installer from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/TexTools/FFXIV_TexTools_UI/releases).

Bugs can reported on our Github [Issues Page](https://github.com/TexTools/FFXIV_TexTools_UI/issues).


## System Requirements

- Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 19h1 (18362) or higher (32 or 64 bit)
- All users require [Visual C++ 2022+ x64 and x86 as well as Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 Redistributables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
- All Users need to have [.Net Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) installed.
- Windows 7 SP1 requires the [Platform Update for Windows 7 (KB2670838)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=36805)
  - Some users will need to uninstall this KB patch and reinstall it due to known/resolved cases where some of the subdependencies were blocked due to outdated/broken display drivers.
  - The installation of this update will also result in a number of other KB updates to present themselves on Windows update, install these to resolve Font clarity, security and stability issues.

### Technical Notes

- The installer will attempt to install the most common missing dependencies.
- Most mods are intended for the DX11 client, requiring a 64bit Windows install.
- There are possible issues with Rivatuner Statistics Server 7.2.2 and older following a Windows update that has changed Windows D3D runtime files. 
  - Update to latest MSIAB or standalone RTSS release.
- Nahimic OSD is known to cause GUI corruption, this is a flaw in Nahimic itself and affects all WPF applications to some degree or other.
  - Nahimic v3 1.8.6 and later is reported to resolve the issue, this will be obtainable from your Mainboard, or Audio device vendor in their respective sound software.
- Microsoft OneDrive based user profiles can cause files saved into the default location to be reverted. 
  - You can either exclude this folder from the OneDrive interface, or change the Modpacks, Index(Backups) and Saved locations to another folder from the customise screen.
- Regions currently on 5.5x will experience issues using versions of TexTools updated for Global 6.0
  - Using an older, or custom version of the current client is the only Workaround.
  
### WARNING

We do not support the use of Textools from, or with application directories placed inside a Onedrive folder, This includes the default User Profile folder created if users blindly click through the first time wizard on a new Windows install.

- These services can cause backup files, and mods themselves to revert or only partially synchronise, resulting in file corruption.
- In other cases, files are not able to be loaded at all because the one drive service has been disabled or uninstalled, in this case a big error message that includes the line "Cloud File Provider is not running." to be thrown when attempting to import, export or create packs.
